# simple standard HTCondor submit file with transfer of the executable and usage of the shared filesystem
# transfer of executable can be handy as you can keep working on the executable locally while the job is running
# without interference with the binary the job is running

# log_dir to be given when called
output              = $(log_dir)/$(Cluster).$(Process).out
error               = $(log_dir)/$(Cluster).$(Process).error
log                 = $(log_dir)/$(Cluster).$(Process).log
# _$(Cluster)_$(Process) gets substituted by cluster and process ID, putting it in the output files leads to individual files
# for each job. Remember that regular filesystem rules about maximum files in a directory and maximum filesizes apply (warning)
# htcondor will (as any other batchsystem) not create any directories for you, hence these need to exist.
